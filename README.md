## Projects

Here you will find some of the personal projects that I created with each project containing its own case study

### Dopefolio

Dopefolio is a successful Open‑Source project that I created. It offers a clean, responsive, and professional design that developers can easily customize to showcase their skills, projects, and experience. The layout, styling, and interactions are created entirely with frontend technologies I’m familiar with, without using any frameworks or build tools. This project demonstrates my ability to design and structure a complete multi‑page website optimized for performance, readability, and user experience.

### Game

This is a single‑page web game I created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages. It provides a fully interactive browser‑based game experience—featuring custom graphics, user input handling, game logic, and responsive layout—that demonstrates my ability to build engaging front‑end game projects. The gameplay visuals and controls are designed entirely with the frontend tools I know, without relying on external engines or frameworks.

### YouTube‑clone

This is a YouTube‑themed static website that I created from scratch using the frontend tools I know, mainly HTML and CSS. The site visually replicates a YouTube‑like homepage by displaying a grid of popular video thumbnails, titles, and view counts. It was built to practice and demonstrate my skills in layout design, responsiveness, and clean user interface development.
